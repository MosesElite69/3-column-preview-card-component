## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Making sure to add multiple classes so these sections so I don't make a rookie mistake, like repeating myself too many times.

```html
<section class="sedans block"></section>
```

Understanding flexbox a little bit more. Might use it more.

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I became nice and familiar with flexbox just a little bit more, and I maybe might start using css grid or anything similar of the sort.

### Useful resources

I used chatGPT like before, but again I always made sure to ask the right questions like, "How can I make the whole button a link instead of just the text". Stuff like that is useful
